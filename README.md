AttendACe is a face recognition attendance system for schools and workplaces. It uses OpenCV and dlib for real-time detection with a QR code backup if recognition fails. Designed for Raspberry Pi but testable on a laptop, it securely stores data using CSV, SQLite, or Firebase for efficient tracking
